"""
The data structures in this package represent different
 aspects of vhdl code. We want to keep them as simple as
 possible. Their responsibility is to allow us to model
 the aspects of the vhdl language, that are necessary
 to automatically generate code from graph structures, e.g.,
 to correctly wire/connect hardware blocks, such that
 we can build a neural network out of blocks representing layers.
